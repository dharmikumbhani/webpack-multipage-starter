#webpack-multipage-starter using webpack5 - three.js

Webpack-multipage (multiple entry points) starter template for creating a multipage static html website.

### Difference between this and main branch:
- CopyWebpackPlugin to have access to textures and other resources directly in the `dist` folder when using three.js.

### To add new pages:
1. Create a folder in the src directory with the name page-<name> and its respective <name>.js, <name>.css and <name>.html files. Make sure that you use the same <name> in all those three places.
2. Go to bundler/webpack.common.config.js and add the <name> as a string to the htmlPageNames array.
3. Re-run the dev server using: npm run dev.
4. Check out that entry point using <local Hosting Address>/<name>.html

### To remove an existing page:
1. Delete the respective folder
2. Remove that <name> from the htmlPagesArray.
3. Re-run the server - npm run dev.
4. That entry point should no longer be accessible.

#### Inspired By - https://github.com/ivarprudnikov/webpack-static-html-pages:

#### Improvements include :
- Splitchunks for common node_modules.
- An easy function that loops through the htmlPageNames array to create HTMl pages easily.
